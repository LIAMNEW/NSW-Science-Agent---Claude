    "in_context": [
      "Students are required to observe or design a chain reaction machine. Students could design and construct a Rube Goldberg machine to represent energy stores and transfers within a complex system. Students could stack several dominoes vertically as a potential energy store.",
      "Process: Attach a string to the top domino. At the top, place a small toy car on a small, inclined ramp. When the dominoes fall, they release potential energy, which is transferred to the toy car. The toy car accelerates down the ramp, converting the potential energy into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the ramp, the toy car collides with a wooden block, transferring its kinetic energy to the block.",
      "Students could document the energy transfers as a factual description or descriptive report.",
      "Students learning English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D) may require support such as scaffolds and explicit teaching of the language of description to produce a description or descriptive report."
